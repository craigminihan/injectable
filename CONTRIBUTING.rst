Contributing
============

Contributions of any kind are welcome in any form.

If you want to submit a code contribution you may do so by forking the project and then
opening a Pull Request to this repository's master branch.

Include a clear and brief description of what your Pull Request is about.

Write unit tests for the code you wrote and add an use case example test if applicable.

Keep in mind that a clear, well organized and readable code is better than a magical,
tricky and hard-to-follow code.

Run ``make black`` to auto-format your code to this project's style guidelines and
run ``make checks`` to ensure there are no linter issues.

While documentation in the form of docstrings are encouraged, code comments are often
discouraged. If your code is so cryptic that you need a comment to clarify it, then
there may be a better way of writing it so the code speaks for itself in a clear way.

Nevertheless, open a Pull Request and it will receive feedback and be reviewed
thoroughly.
